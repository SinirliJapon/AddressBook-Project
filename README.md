# AddressBook-Project

In my 5th semester, I contributed to the design and development of a web application with a user interface and a database. 
The application includes full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality, as well as a sorting function. 
The entire application runs using Docker Compose. We used Python Flask as the programming language and MySQL as the database. 
I primarily focused on designing the frontend aspect of the application.

# How to Run

1.	write "docker-compose up" to the folder's terminal
2.	go to /localhost:5000 in your browser
